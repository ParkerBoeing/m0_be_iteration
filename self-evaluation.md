# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful? I can see the `each` method being used in a wide variety of scenarios, but specifically if you're working with large arrays and need to run similar commands on large sets within that array.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
I definitely need more practice getting comfortable with the `each` method in general. It is new syntax and language for me. The best thing I can do is increase my exposure by practicing extra on my own time.
- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment? Taking a break! At one point I was getting pretty frustrated trying to get if / else statements to work within each iterations. Couldn't quite figure it out. Took a bath and lo and behold, turns out I was only putting one end at the end.
